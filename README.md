# Tic-Tac-Toe ðŸŽ®

A repository documenting the learning process for the Kotlin project *Tic-Tac-Toe* from [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/).

## About
This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Kotlin with the following features:
- Interactive gameplay between two players (X and O)
- Validates player inputs and ensures correct moves
- Displays the game board after every move
- Detects win conditions, draw states, and announces the game outcome

## Features
- **Interactive Game**: Players take turns making moves until the game concludes.
- **Input Validation**: Handles invalid inputs, out-of-range coordinates, and occupied cells.
- **Win Detection**: Checks rows, columns, and diagonals for a winning state.
- **Draw State Handling**: Detects when the board is full without a winner.
- **Board Display**: Visually represents the current state of the game board after every move.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I learned:
- Object-oriented programming in Kotlin
- Handling user input and input validation
- Implementing game logic and win/draw state detection
- Managing mutable states in a Kotlin application
- Using companion objects for constants
- Structuring code for readability and maintainability
